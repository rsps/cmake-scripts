# Version x.x Placeholder

!!! note
    This is a placeholder for documentation of a previous release. It is kept here to illustrate the intended
    directory structure.

    The contents of this placeholder is **NOT** intended to be shown in the final documentation. Please ensure
    that it is ignored, in the `config.js` (_[daux configuration](https://daux.io/Configuration/index.html)_)

## How to archive documentation

1. Create a new directory in the `/-archive` directory, name it `v[major-version]x`, e.g. `v3x`.
2. Copy and paste the contents of the `/+current` directory into the new directory, in the `/-archive` directory.
3. Commit your changes.
4. You can now safely update the contents of `/+current` to reflect the new major version.
