# `next` version placeholder

!!! note
    This is a placeholder for documentation for an upcoming release. It is kept here to illustrate the intended
    directory structure.

    The contents of this placeholder is **NOT** intended to be shown in the final documentation. Please ensure
    that it is ignored, in the `config.js` (_[daux configuration](https://daux.io/Configuration/index.html)_)

## How to work on `next` release documentation

1. Copy and paste the contents of the `/+current` directory into this directory
2. Rename the `title` of the `index.md` to "next"
3. Commit your changes.
4. Update the contents of the documentation to reflect the next major version.

Once you are ready to release the next major version, archive the contents of `/+current`, and move the contents
of the "next" into the `/+current` directory. Rename the `title` to reflect the newly released major version.
